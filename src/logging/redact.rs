//! Secret redaction for anything on its way into a log.
//!
//! The Telegram Bot API puts the bot token in the URL path, and `reqwest`'s
//! error `Display` carries the failing URL, so `tracing::warn!("...: {e}")` on
//! any Telegram call writes the token to disk in plaintext (#1322). Anyone
//! with read access to the log directory then has the bot, as does anyone
//! handed a log excerpt in a bug report.
//!
//! Nothing at those call sites is doing anything unusual: logging a transport
//! error is right, and the token rides along invisibly. That is what makes a
//! per-site fix unreliable, and there are over a hundred such sites. So the
//! redaction lives at the writer instead, where every event passes through
//! whatever its origin, and [`scrub`] is exposed for call sites that want to
//! redact earlier.

//! Classifying per-member menu scope failures (#839).
//!
//! Global `allowed_users` are admins allowed in every group, so their menus
//! must be cleared wherever they are members. But nothing tells us which
//! groups those are: the config records a global grant, not a roster.
//!
//! Telegram answers a `BotCommandScope::ChatMember` call for a user who is not
//! in that chat with an invalid-id error, and that is the only membership
//! signal available here. `getChatMember` fails the same way for a user the bot
//! has never seen in the chat, so probing first costs a round trip per user per
//! group and still errors. The failed call is the membership test.

/// The bot owner's numeric user id, or `None` when the allow-list carries no
/// resolvable id at all.
///
/// `allowed_users` is a *list*, not an ordered pair: the shipped convention
/// permits the wildcard `"*"` anywhere in it, and plenty of real configs put
/// it first (`allowed_users = ["*", "1608111860"]`). Callers used to take
/// `.first()` and parse it, which returned `None` on exactly those configs —
/// and every owner-menu path treats `None` as "no owner configured", so
/// `register_scoped_menus` returned early and the Telegram `/` picker was
/// left with nothing but `/start`. The first entry that parses wins;
/// non-numeric entries (`"*"`, channel handles, typos) are skipped instead of
/// aborting the lookup.

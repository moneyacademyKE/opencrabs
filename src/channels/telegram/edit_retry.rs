//! Shared Retry-After handling for best-effort UI-edit legs (#68).
//!
//! Before this module every decoration leg (tap pick-record, courtesy
//! notes) fired exactly once: a Telegram 429 killed it, the immediate
//! fallback fired ~100ms later INTO the same flood window and was dead by
//! construction, and the user saw a consumed tap with no visible effect
//! (incident 2026-09-01 18:17:26Z: pick-record edit 429 "Retry after 12s",
//! echo fallback 429 105ms later, bubble showed nothing).
//!
//! Model, proven by #30's deferred placement: attempt 1 fires immediately;
//! on a Retry-After the caller spawns a deferred task that sleeps EXACTLY
//! the server-instructed window (capped — nothing blocks while it waits),
//! re-fires the SAME prebuilt payload once, and only on exhaustion hands
//! off to the legacy fallback — which by then runs safely outside the 429
//! window.

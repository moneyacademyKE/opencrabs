//! Shared helpers for background-task resume across channels (#731).
//!
//! When a detached long command finishes, the [`BackgroundTaskManager`] calls
//! the surface's `MessageEnqueueCallback` with the originating `session_id` and
//! a synthetic completion message. Each channel's callback resolves its delivery
//! target, runs a fresh turn feeding the completion text as the prompt, and
//! delivers the result back to that target. The turn-running and weak-agent
//! plumbing is identical across channels and lives here; only target lookup and
//! the SDK-specific send call are per-channel.
//!

//! Semantics for a secret input pre-filled with [`EXISTING_KEY_SENTINEL`].
//!
//! When a dialog opens on a provider that already has a stored key, the input
//! is seeded with the sentinel rather than the secret itself, so the key is
//! never rendered. That marker has to mean the same thing to everything that
//! looks at the field, and it did not: the renderer read it as "no key here"
//! while the save path read it as a value worth writing. The result was a
//! stored key that displayed as absent and was then overwritten with the
//! literal marker on the next save (#1039).
//!
//! One module, so both halves agree by construction:
//!
//! - [`is_configured`] — is a key set at all, stored or freshly typed? Drives
//!   display.
//! - [`typed_secret`]: what did the user actually type, if anything? Drives
//!   writes. The sentinel never survives this, alone or as a prefix.
//! - [`masked`] — what to show in the field, never the secret.

/// True when the field still carries the "a key is already stored" marker.
///
/// Prefix, not equality. Clearing on the first keystroke is best effort and was
/// missing on three voice fields, so a pre-filled field that is typed into can
/// hold `__EXISTING_KEY__<typed>`. An equality test reads that as a freshly
/// typed secret, which is how a real key ended up stored with the marker glued
/// to its front, a value that fails auth exactly like a wrong key with nothing
/// on screen to say why.

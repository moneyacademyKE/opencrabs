//! Config hot-reload watcher.
//!
//! Watches the `~/.opencrabs/` directory and reacts to changes of
//! `config.toml`, `keys.toml`, and `commands.toml`. On any modification it
//! re-loads the full `Config` and fires all registered callbacks. Watching the
//! directory (rather than the files directly) is deliberate: atomic saves
//! rename a temp file over the target, which a file-level watch would miss.
//!
//! Designed to be extended: register any channel state update or command reload
//! by pushing a `ReloadCallback` via `spawn()`.

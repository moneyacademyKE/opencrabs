//! The set of real config sections, and what a write may address (#1199).
//!
//! Reads and writes disagreed about what a section is. The read path resolves
//! shorthand (`stt` -> `providers`) against a registry; the write path
//! accepted any dotted string and created whatever tables it named. A caller
//! that passed `opencode` instead of `providers.opencode` got `Ok(())`, an
//! orphan `[opencode]` table at the end of `config.toml`, and a value serde
//! discards on every load. Reads then keep reporting the old value, which
//! looks exactly like a stale cache.
//!
//! The registry lives here rather than in the config tool because both sides
//! need it and `config` cannot depend on `brain::tools`.

/// Top-level tables that actually exist in `config.toml`.
///
/// A write path must START at one of these. Anything else is an orphan by
/// construction, whatever it looks like.
///
/// Pinned to the compiled schema by the drift guard in
/// `src/tests/rsi_stale_scan_test.rs` (#1385): this list once carried a
/// phantom `voice` entry and lacked eight real sections (`daemon`, `a2a`,
/// `image`, `cron`, `memory`, `brain`, `browser`, `doctor`), so writes to
/// real sections were refused while writes to `voice` created tables serde
/// silently discarded.
///
/// `voice` is deliberately absent: it is a derived read-only view over
/// `providers.stt`/`providers.tts`, not a table. `config read voice` still
/// works (dispatched before section resolution); writes get a tailored
/// rejection in [`validate_write_path`].

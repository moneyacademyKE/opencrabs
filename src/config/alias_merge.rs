//! Fold a legacy section name into its canonical one before deserializing.
//!
//! `Config` reaches the A2A settings through `#[serde(alias = "gateway")]`, so
//! a file may spell that section either way. serde treats an alias as another
//! spelling of the same field, not as a second field, so a file carrying BOTH
//! `[gateway]` and `[a2a]` fails with `duplicate field \`a2a\`` — reported
//! against line 1, nowhere near either section (#1116).
//!
//! The load path then treated that like a syntax error and fell back to the
//! last-known-good snapshot, so the instance ran on a stale copy and every
//! later edit appeared to do nothing.
//!
//! Two sections naming one feature is the underlying problem. Until the legacy
//! spelling can be retired outright, this folds them together before serde
//! sees the document: the two tables merge into the canonical key and the file
//! parses as though it had been written with one section all along. Nobody has
//! to choose which to delete, and nothing is silently dropped.

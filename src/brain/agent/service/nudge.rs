// ── Pre-compaction context-pressure warning (#909) ──
//
// Compaction is reactive today: Tier-1 fires at 65% and clips the conversation
// with no prior warning. The model never gets a chance to deliberately finish
// its current sub-task and persist critical state before the clip.
//
// These helpers define a warning band (55-64%) just below the trigger. When
// usage enters the band, a behavioural nudge is appended to the system brain
// telling the model to persist state to disk NOW. It is a nudge, not a number,
// because `context.token_count` is a tiktoken estimate for all providers at
// the point this runs - a precise percentage would repeat the units-confusion
// that caused #896, and the model can't trigger compaction anyway, so the only
// useful signal is the instruction itself.
//
// The nudge is transient: it rides on `system_brain`, which is rebuilt from
// disk every turn, so it never lands in the DB. A per-session throttle flag
// (held on AgentService) suppresses repeat warnings while usage lingers in the
// band and re-arms when it drops below the band floor.

/// Lower edge of the warning band (inclusive). Below this the throttle re-arms
/// so a fresh entry into the band warns again.

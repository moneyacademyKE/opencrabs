//! What a tool-call loop guard does when it gives up on the current model
//! (#1397).
//!
//! Three guards in the tool loop end a turn when the model keeps re-issuing
//! the same call: the strictly-consecutive modification guard, the
//! near-match guard, and the identical-call dominance guard. Until #1397
//! each of them appended a breadcrumb and returned the partial response as
//! the turn's answer. That dropped the pending call on the floor and never
//! consulted the fallback chain, while every sibling failure (stream drop,
//! phantom calls, reasoning-only turns, announcement loops) walks that
//! chain before the turn is allowed to end. A different model does not
//! reproduce the same loop, which is the whole reason the chain exists.
//!
//! The break is now the provider-attributable [`ProviderError::AnnouncementLoop`]
//! the #1023 rotation wrapper already reacts to: it promotes the next
//! provider and replays the turn, and only when `force_next_fallback` has
//! nowhere left to go does the error reach the user. The message carries the
//! raw pending call so a break is never silent about what did not run.

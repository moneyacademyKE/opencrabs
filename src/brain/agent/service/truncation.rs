//! Truncated-mid-sentence response detection and one-shot continuation.
//!
//! Local reasoning models (notably Qwen3.6-35B on MLX) periodically emit
//! an EOS token mid-sentence — the response looks complete from a
//! protocol standpoint (proper `finish_reason=stop` + usage chunk) but
//! the visible text ends mid-word. This module owns the decision to
//! ask the model to continue once.
//!
//! Extracted from `tool_loop.rs` (was lines 2800-2866) as part of the
//! 2026-05-04 Linor-flagged refactor: tool_loop.rs was 4,047 lines.
//! Behaviour is unchanged from the pre-extraction version. The
//! detection heuristic itself lives in `phantom::looks_truncated_mid_
//! sentence` — that boundary already existed.
//!
//! Coupling with bug-B (commit 03d0524e):
//! `current_iter_is_truncation_continue` is set by the caller AFTER
//! this returns true, so the stream-error path on the NEXT iteration
//! skips cross-provider fallback. We don't try to bundle that flag
//! into this module because it lives on the loop's own state and only
//! has meaning relative to the next stream attempt.

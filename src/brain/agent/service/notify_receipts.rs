//! Notify receipts (fork #50, confirmation depth 3): the sender's
//! `notify_id` becomes a checkable contract instead of a fire-and-forget
//! hope. The session message queue is per-target, so when the tool-loop
//! drain point fires for a target, every notify queued for that target is
//! consumed by definition — no id field on `QueuedUserMessage` is needed,
//! the drain stamps by target and the sender polls by id.

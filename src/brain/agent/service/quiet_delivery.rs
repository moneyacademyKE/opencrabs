//! Quiet delivery engine (Notifications v2, fork #50).
//!
//! Holds a deferred notification until the target session has been quiet
//! for a window: no active turn, and `quiet_for` elapsed since the last
//! observed turn end. Any turn activity restarts the clock. A starvation
//! cap (`max_delay`) forces delivery — queueing into the running turn —
//! so a permanently busy session cannot defer a notice forever.
//!
//! The quiet clock is PER TARGET, stored in the registry (not on a
//! watcher's stack): every watcher for a target reads and restarts the
//! same clock, and a batch sweep sees every entry's real window.
//!
//! Release is a per-target BATCH: when one deferred entry becomes due,
//! every entry for the same target that is due under the same clock drains
//! together — the first wakes the session, the rest ride the woken turn's
//! boundaries. Route (and the fork #17/#19 channel-ownership gate)
//! re-evaluates at fire time via `deliver_to_session`.

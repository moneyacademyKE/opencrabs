//! Compaction logic is cohesive — one async method that decides between
//! the soft 65 % LLM-summarisation tier, the 90 % hard-truncate floor,
//! and the safety-net truncation when all attempts fail. Lives next to

//!
//! Behaviour is unchanged from the pre-extraction version. The

//! because they document the regression history (pre-0f052250 shape,
//! cancellation race details, the failed async-spawn variant).

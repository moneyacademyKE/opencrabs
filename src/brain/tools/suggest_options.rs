//! `suggest_options` tool.
//!
//! Lets the agent surface OPTIONAL next-step suggestions the user may accept or
//! ignore. This is non-blocking: it fires a
//! `ProgressEvent::SuggestedOptions` and returns immediately without awaiting
//! any answer. Each surface renders the options as its own INTERACTIVE UI —
//! tap-to-send buttons under the reply on chat channels (Telegram/Discord/…), a
//! pick-list or gray ghost-text accept in the TUI. The rendering is the tool's
//! job; the model must NOT write the suggestions as plain text in its reply, or
//! they land as dead text with no button to tap.
//!
//! Intended for "here's a likely next thing you might ask" — a convenience, not
//! a question. If the agent genuinely cannot proceed without a choice, it should
//! ask directly in your reply instead.

CHANNEL-AGNOSTIC interactive UI: tap-to-send buttons under your reply on chat channels (Telegram/Discord/...), a pick-list or gray ghost-text accept in the TUI. You MUST call this tool to make options interactive: writing them as plain text leaves dead text with no button to tap. If this is your final action of the turn, the turn ends with the options pending the user's pick (#1178 turn-halt); mid-turn calls attach the options to your message without stopping you. Use ONE option for an obvious single next step — a one-tap confirm (\"Go\", \"Confirm\", \"Agreed\") is often easier for the user than typing the word, and single-option sets are always legal; 2-8 for distinct next directions. Each option must be a complete, ready-to-send user message phrased in the user's voice (e.g. \"Add tests for the new endpoint\", not \"I could add tests\"). Keep each under ~60 chars. Do NOT use this to ask a question you need answered to proceed; do not also repeat the options in your prose."

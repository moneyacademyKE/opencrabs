//! Client identification headers, resolved per gateway.
//!
//! Requests on the OpenAI-compatible path carry only `Authorization`,
//! `Content-Type` and `Accept`. `reqwest` sends no `User-Agent` of its own, so
//! until a provider opts in, OpenCrabs reaches a gateway anonymously. OpenCode
//! Zen is the first to act on that: it asked for a `User-Agent` and a stable
//! per-conversation `X-Opencode-Session`, and warned that requests without the
//! session header may be rejected (#1329).
//!
//! The same anonymity applies to every other gateway we talk to, so this
//! module resolves identity per host: z.ai (#1331), ModelScope (#1332),
//! Kimi/Moonshot (#1333) and DeepSeek (#1334), which users reach through a
//! custom endpoint since it has no first-class provider.
//!
//! ## Why this is per-vendor and not a default on the client
//!
//! A gateway fingerprints the header set it receives. [`super::qwen`]
//! documents how sending headers a provider does not expect drops us into a
//! stricter rate-limit bucket, and both User-Agents already in the codebase
//! (`QwenCode/...`, `GitHubCopilotChat/...`) deliberately impersonate other
//! clients for that reason. Setting `.user_agent(...)` on the shared client
//! would silently overwrite those, so identity is opt-in per host and
//! [`headers_for`] returns nothing for anything it does not recognise.

//! Tests for the #1226 K fix and the #31 trailer reclaim.
//!
//! #1226 incident (smoke v3, 2026-08-28): the model delivered its final
//! answer mid-turn, then called suggest_options; the turn halted with
//! `options_pending`, the promote branch asked for the folded final, got
//! None silently, and the answer stayed imprisoned (badly formatted) in
//! the flow block while the buttons landed standalone.
//!
//! The fix gives `pop_trailing_folded_texts` an options-aware gate: when
//! options are pending it lifts the trailing Tool run aside, pops the Text
//! run immediately before it, and RESTORES the Tool run on top — only the
//! answer text leaves the block, the tool history stays. The gate never
//! fires on turns that did not halt on an option surface.
//!
//! #31 extension (smoke v4 abandonment): after the halt, the model's
//! text-only sign-off iteration folds ANOTHER Text run into the flow —
//! AFTER the suggest_options Tool entry. The gate now returns BOTH runs:
//! `(host, trailer)` — the answer before the Tool, the sign-off after it.
//! Nothing is discarded; `settle_options_reclaim` arbitrates against
//! `response.content` (host wins the content slot, duplicates die,
//! an unfolded content leftover is promoted to the trailer).

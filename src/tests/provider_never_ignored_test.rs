//! A configured provider is never removed from consideration (#1251).
//!
//! #952 shipped a process-global quarantine table: a provider whose API
//! reported a hard quota was marked exhausted for an hour, and every fallback
//! walk skipped it. The table was keyed by provider name with no model
//! dimension, so one dead model blacked out every model on that provider, for
//! every session in the process, on the strength of a single error. It also
//! marked the user's own active pick.
//!
//! The rule these tests lock: the system reports failures, the human decides.
//! Nothing is skipped, and a failure on one turn is never remembered as a
//! reason to not try again on the next.

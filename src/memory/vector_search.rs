//! Chunk-aware vector search over the memory store (#998).
//!
//! A vector search that joins `vectors_vec` on `d.hash || '_0'` can only
//! ever see a document's FIRST chunk. Once documents are chunked, every
//! chunk past the first would be embedded, stored, and then never queried,
//! which is the worst of both worlds: the cost of chunking with none of the
//! benefit. This was written as a shim around that bug in the then-qmd
//! store and became the real implementation when qmd was dropped (#1028).
//!
//! It reads on its own connection rather than through `Store`:
//!
//! - The connection is opened read-only. The database runs in WAL mode, so
//!   this reader never blocks the store's writer and vice versa, and the
//!   search path can run it while holding the store lock.
//! - No schema of its own. It queries what `db.rs` writes.
//!
//! Scoring: cosine similarity computed in Rust over f32 vectors stored as
//! little-endian bytes. `vectors_vec` is a plain table, not a vector-index
//! extension, so this is a linear scan — the right trade at memory-index
//! scale (hundreds to low thousands of chunks).
